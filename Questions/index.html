        <h1>Asynchronous code</h1>
        <p>In JavaScript we have the concept of ‘asynchronous’ code. This simply means code that does not run instantly
            in line. Perhaps the code needs to wait a moment, wait for something to happen, or in the case we will
            explore today, wait until data comes back from a server. </p>
        <p>JS can do two things at same time, example api call</p>

        <h2>For Asynchronous Code we can use Promises, Async Await or Callbacks</h2>
        <h2>Promises</h2>
        <p>Built into ES6</p>
        <p>tells browser task is finished</p>
        <p>Promises are a design pattern for use when handling asynchronous code in JavaScript. We use them as an
            alternative to nesting multiple callbacks. You may have heard of a problem called callback hell.</p>
        <p>If the promise succeeds, it will return the value as a parameter into a callback passed into .then(). If the
            promise fails, the callback passed into the .catch() runs, taking an error as its argument.</p>
        <p>
            <li>Use promises whenever you are using asynchronous or blocking code.</li>
            <li> resolve maps to then and reject maps to catch for all practical purposes.</li>
            <li> Make sure to write both .catch and .then methods for all the promises.</li>
            <li> If something needs to be done in both the cases use .finally</li>
            <li> We only get one shot at mutating each promise.</li>
            <li> We can add multiple handlers to a single promise.</li>
            <li> The return type of all the methods in Promise object whether they are static methods or prototype
                methods is again a Promise</li>
            <li> In Promise.all the order of the promises are maintained in values variable irrespective of which
                promise was first resolved.</li>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>async await</h2>
        <p>
            <li>async functions returns a promise.</li>
            <li>async functions returns a promise.</li>
            <li>async functions use an implicit Promise to return its result. Even if you don’t return a promise
                explicitly async function makes sure that your code is passed through a promise.</li>
            <li> await blocks the code execution within the async function, of which it(await statement) is a part.</li>
            <li>There can be multiple await statements within a single async function.</li>
            <li>When using async await make sure to use try catch for error handling.</li>
            <li>Be extra careful when using await within loops and iterators. You might fall into the trap of writing
                sequentially executing code when it could have been easily done in parallel.</li>
            <li>await is always for a single promise.</li>
            <li>Promise creation starts the execution of asynchronous functionality.</li>
            <li>await only blocks the code execution within the async function. It only makes sure that next line is
                executed when the promise resolves. So if an asynchronous activity has already started then await will
                not have an effect on it.</li>
        </p>

        <h1>ES6</h1>
        <p>Benefits</p>
        <p>Promise</p>
        <p>destructuring</p>
        <p>var list = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
            var [ a, , b ] = list
            [ b, a ] = [ a, b ]</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Hoisting</h1>
        <p>declarations of variables are hoisted to the top in JS, example: let x or var y</p>
        <p>Initialized values are not hoisted, ex: var x = 5</p>
        <p>If you don't understand, can cause errors in code.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Scope</h1>
        <p>Types of Scope</p>
        <p>In JavaScript there are three types of scope:</p>

        <li>Global Scope — variables can be accessed everywhere.</li>
        <li>Function Scope — variables can be accessed in the boundaries of the function in which they are defined.</li>
        <li>Block Scope — variables can be accessed in the block in which they are defined. A block is separated by {
            and }.</li>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>use strict</h1>
        <p>Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Using a variable or object without declaring it, is not allowed</p>
        <p>deleting a variable, object or function is not allowed</p>
        <p>eval and arguements cannot be used as variables</p>
        <p>this word cannot be used without defining an object</p>
        <p>following words cannot be used as variables:implements
            interface
            let
            package
            private
            protected
            public
            static
            yield</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Advantages of JavaScript</h1>
        <h3>Speed</h3>
        <p>does not need calls to a backend server</p>
        <p>Nor does it need to be compiled by the client</p>
        <p>client side, so reduces demand on webserver</p>
        <h3>Useability</h3>
        <p>Javascript is highly used and supported</p>
        <p>works well with other languages, can be inserted into other file types</p>
        <h3>Third party scripts</h3>
        <p>Can be used on third party scripts. Such as pop-up ads on random websites. Does not need to be tied to one
            website</p>

    <div>
        <h1>Disadvantages of JS</h1>
        <p>Client-side security. Because code executes on users computer, can be used for malicious purposes</p>
        <p>Browser support, JS is sometimes interpreted differently by different browsers.</p>
    </div>


    <div>
        <h1>Dot notation</h1>
        <p>most commonly used with objects</p>
        <p>easier to right and read</p>
        <p>let obj = {
            cat: 'meow',
            dog: 'woof'
            };
            let sound = obj.cat;</p>
        <p>Property identifies can only be alphanumeric (and _ and $)</p>
        <p> Property identifiers cannot start with a number.</p>
        <p>Property identifiers cannot contain variables.</p>
        <p>OK — obj.prop_1, obj.prop$</p>
        <p>Not OK — obj.1prop, obj.prop name</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h1>Bracket notation</h1>
        <p> used with arrays and objects</p>
        <p>let obj = {
            cat: 'meow',
            dog: 'woof'
            };
            let sound = obj['cat'];</p>
        <p>Dynamic</p>
        <p>can use variables with bracket notation, not dot notation</p>
        <p>let obj = {
            cat: 'meow',
            dog: 'woof'
            };
            let dog = 'cat';
            let sound = obj[dog];
            console.log(sound);
            // meow</p>
        <p>Property identifiers have to be a String or a variable that references a String.</p>
        <p>It is okay to use variables, spaces, and Strings that start with numbers</p>
        <p>OK — obj["1prop"], obj["prop name"]</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Constructor</h3>
        <p>create blueprint of an object</object></p>
        <p>
            function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
            this.firstName = first;
            this.lastName = last;
            this.age = age;
            this.eyeColor = eye;
            }
        </p>
        <p>can create object with new</p>
        <p>var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");</p>
        <p> var myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Singleton</h3>
        <p>Only a single instance.</p>
        <p>var user = {
            name: 'Shruti Kapoor',
            location: 'SF',
            intro: function() {
            return this.name + ', ' + this.location
            }
            }</p>

        <p>You can only have a single instance</p>
        <p> You need to manage the state of this instance.</p>
        <p> You do not care about initialization of this instance at runtime.</p>
        <p>You need to access it across your app.</p>
